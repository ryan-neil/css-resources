# Quick HTML Tips

### Tags

When it comes to HTML tags, some general guidelines to follow are:

`<h1>` - One per page.

`<h2>` - One per major section.

`<section>` - Use `section` tags to group the main sections of the page (hero, projects, etc.).

`<article>` - Use article tags to group smaller sections within the sections. If it's a "projects" section, each "project" could be wrapped in an `article` tag.

### File Paths

Not too long after we start learning HTML, you start learning how to link to other HTML and CSS files. It is fairly straight forward when the files are in the same directory. Where it starts to get more complicated is when we need to go up a directory instead of (or before) going down into one.

In the example below, we are setting the background-image for a web page in our `main.css` file. The `main.css` file is in the `CSS` directory. We are linking to an image in the `img` directory.

```css
body {
  background-image: url('../img/moon.png');
}
```

Both of these directories (aka folders) are in the `root` directory. Therefore, we need to go up and out of the `CSS` directory and then down into the `img` directory.

We go up one directory with two dots: "`..`"

From there, we go down into the `img` directory to link to the `moon.png` file.

If we needed to go up two directories, the file path would start like this: "`../../`"

> Remember, one dot indicates the directory you are in. Two dots indicates the directory above where you currently are.

# Centering a Div

Yes, the dreaded centering in CSS... There are many ways to achieve this but luckily **Flex** and **Grid** have made our lives much easier.

For each example we will be using the following HTML:

```html
<div class="outer-div">
  <div class="inner-div"></div>
</div>
```

Each example will have these root CSS styles:

```css
.outer-div {
  background-color: #e3e3e3;
  width: 600px;
  height: 200px;
}

.inner-div {
  background-color: #0578d3;
  width: 250px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

We have a 600x200 grey outer div, and a 250x100 blue inner div. The goal is to center the blue div vertically and horizontally inside the red div.

<p align="left">
  <img src="/src/assets/css-center-div-01.png" width="300" alt="css-center-div">
</p>

We should get this end result:

<p align="left">
  <img src="/src/assets/css-center-div-02.png" width="300" alt="css-center-div">
</p>

### Centering with Flexbox:

```css
.outer-div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

OR

```css
.outer-div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.inner-div {
  align-self: center;
}
```

### Centering with Grid:

```css
.outer-div {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```

OR

```css
.outer-div {
  display: grid;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

OR

```css
.outer-div {
  display: grid;
}

.inner-div {
  align-self: center;
  justify-self: center;
}
```

### Absolute Positioning:

```css
.outer-div {
  position: relative;
}

.inner-div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

OR

```css
.outer-div {
  position: relative;
}

.inner-div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  margin: auto;
}
```

# Variables

The `var()` function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable. CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.

**Syntax**:

```css
var(name, value)
```

> Note: The variable name must begin with two dashes (`--`) and it is case sensitive!

Global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared.

To create a variable with global scope, declare it inside the `:root` selector. The `:root` selector matches the document's root element.

To create a variable with local scope, declare it inside the selector that is going to use it.

**Example**:

```css
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
}
```

Advantages of using var() are:

- makes the code easier to read (more understandable).
- makes it much easier to change the color, sizing and spacing values.

### Changing CSS Variables with JavaScript

CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can change them with JavaScript.

**Example**:

```js
// get the root element
const root = document.querySelector(':root');

// Create a function for getting a variable value
function getVariableValue() {
  // get the styles (properties and values) for the root
  const rootStyle = getComputedStyle(root);
  // print the value of the --white variable
  rootStyle.getPropertyValue('--white'); // -> #ffffff
}

// Create a function for setting a variable value
function setVariableValue() {
  // Set the value of variable --white to another value (in this case "gray")
  root.style.setProperty('--white', 'gray');
}
```

# BEM

The **Block**, **Element**, **Modifier** methodology (commonly referred to as **BEM**) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. Its goal is to help developers better understand the relationship between the HTML and CSS in a given project.

```css
.block__element--modifier
```

### Resources:

- [Battling BEM CSS: 10 Common Problems And How To Avoid Them](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/battling-bem-extended-edition-common-problems-and-how-to-avoid-them/)

Here's an example of what writing in the BEM style might look like:

```css
/* Block component */
.btn {
}

/* Element that depends upon the block */
.btn__primary {
}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.btn__primary--blue {
}
.btn__primary--small {
}
```

In this CSS methodology a **block** is a top-level abstraction of a new component, for example a button: `.btn {}`. This block should be thought of as a parent.

Child items, or **elements**, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block like `.btn__primary {}`.

Finally, **modifiers** can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block just like `.btn__primary--blue`.

The HTML markup might then look like this:

```html
<a class="btn" href="">
  <button class="btn__primary--blue">Submit</button>
</a>
<a class="btn" href="">
  <button class="btn__secondary--red">Cancel</button>
</a>
```

#### So why should we consider using BEM?

1. If we want to make a new style of a component, we can easily see which modifiers and children already exist. We might even realize we don’t need to write any CSS in the first place because there is a pre-existing modifier that does what we need.

2. If we are reading the markup instead of CSS, we should be able to quickly get an idea of which element depends on another (in the previous example we can see that `.btn__primary` depends on `.btn`, even if we don’t know what that does just yet.)

3. Designers and developers can consistently name components for easier communication between team members. In other words, BEM gives everyone on a project a declarative syntax that they can share so that they’re on the same page.

For my visual learners out there:

<p align="left">
  <img src="/src/assets/css-bem.png" width="525" alt="CSS BEM">
</p>

Although BEM won't solve all of our problems it is extraordinarily useful for constructing scalable and maintainable interfaces where everyone on the team should have a clear idea of how things can be improved.

This is because a great deal of front end development is not just about the nice tricks that solve one little problem in the short term; we need agreements, promises and binding social contracts between developers so that our codebase can adapt over time.

}
```

### RGB:

RGB numbers are based upon monitor settings of red, green, and blue light. By changing the RGB numbers, you’re telling your monitor how much of that particular light color you want to shine.

RGB defines the values of red (the first number), green (the second number), or blue (the third number). The number 0 signifies no representation of the color and 255 signifies the highest possible concentration of the color.

`RGB(255, 0, 0)`

In the above example, you get the brightest red possible without any green or blue presented. If you wanted only green, you’d use `RGB(0, 255, 0)` and for blue, `RGB(0, 0, 255)`.

### Hexadecimal (Hex):

We use hexadecimal numbers because it’s a human-friendly representation of values in binary code. Hex color codes start with a pound sign or hashtag (#) and are followed by six letters and/or numbers.

The first two letters/numbers refer to _red_, the next two refer to _green_, and the last two refer to _blue_. The color values are defined in values between 00 and FF (instead of from 0 to 255 in RGB).

Numbers are used when the value is 1-9. Letters are used when the value is higher than 9. \
`A = 10` \
`B = 11` \
`C = 12` \
`D = 13` \
`E = 14` \
`F = 15`

To get a hexadecimal color, we simply follow these three steps:

1. Multiply the first number (or converted number from the letter) by 16.
1. Multiply the second number (or converted number from the letter) by 1.
1. Add those two totals together to get a single value.

For example, the hexadecimal number for the number 83 is actually 131. We come to this conclusion by:

1. Multiplying the 8 in 83 by 16 (8x16=128).
1. Multiplying the 3 in 83 by 1 (3x1=3).
1. Adding the two totals together (128+3=131).

Working with letters is the same concept. For example, FF = 255 because you multiply the number that represents F (15) by 16, then multiply the number that represents the second F (15) by 1. Then add the two totals together to equal 255. Recognize that the number 255 is the same as the RGB number 255, which is bright red.

# Depth

### Resources:

- [Microsoft Depth](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/elevation)
- [Generate Box Shadows](https://shadows.brumm.af/)

Depth (also referred to as elevation) is used to draw focus to an experience and add a physical materiality to the app. Shallow levels are reserved for items that are closely connected to the canvas or view, such as tiles. Deeper levels create a prominent frame around the surface, drawing strong focus to self-contained experiences like dialogs.

Template:

```css
:root {
  /* box shadows */
  --shadow-1: 0 1px 3px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  --shadow-2: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  --shadow-3: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 4px 6px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  --shadow-4: 0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 10px 10px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
}
```

The following examples are based on Microsoft's UI elevation chart:

### Depth Level 4:

Usage:

- Cards
- Grid item thumbnails

```css
.card.depth4 {
  box-shadow: 0 1.6px 3.6px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.132), 0 0.3px 0.9px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.108);
}
```

<p align="left">
  <img src="/src/assets/card-depth-4.png" width="260" alt="depth-4-card">
</p>

### Depth Level 8:

Usage:

- Command bars
- Command dropdowns
- Context menus

```css
.card.depth8 {
  box-shadow: 0 3.2px 7.2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.132), 0 0.6px 1.8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.108);
}
```

<p align="left">
  <img src="/src/assets/card-depth-8.png" width="265" alt="depth-8-card">
</p>

### Depth Level 16:

Usage:

- Teaching callouts
- Search results dropdown
- Hover cards
- Tooltips

```css
.card.depth16 {
  box-shadow: 0 6.4px 14.4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.132), 0 1.2px 3.6px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.108);
}
```

<p align="left">
  <img src="/src/assets/card-depth-16.png" width="270" alt="depth-16-card">
</p>

### Depth Level 64:

Usage:

- Panels
- Pop up dialogs

```css
.card.depth64 {
  box-shadow: 0 25.6px 57.6px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22), 0 4.8px 14.4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18);
}

# Icons

### Resources:

- [700+ CSS Icons (with svg code)](https://css.gg/)
- [Google Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)

### Google Icons:

Icon fonts are fonts that contain symbols and glyphs instead of letters or numbers. A major advantage of icon fonts is they scale very nicely; they increase in size with much better quality than raster images. Also, since a font icon is text, CSS can easily be applied to adjust the size and change the color.

To use Google Icon Fonts, add the following line inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<head>
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</head>
```

Next, to incorporate the icons into our webpage, add the following line wherever we want the icon in our HTML file:

```html
<body>
  <span class="material-icons" style="color:blue;">cloud</span>
</body>
```

OR

```html
<body>
  <i class="material-icons" style="color:blue;">cloud</i>
</body>
```

Output:

<img src="/src/assets/cloud.svg" width="50">

# Fonts

### Resources:

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Font Pairing](https://fontjoy.com/)
- [Font Sizing - Type Scale](https://type-scale.com/)

### Google Fonts

Google Fonts is a library of more than a thousand free and open source font families and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS.

To add Google Fonts to our project, add a special style sheet link to the `<head>` section. Here's an example using my current favorite font, Quicksand:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Quicksand:wght@300;400;500&display=swap"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</head>
```

Now we must refer to the font in our CSS file:

```css
html {
  font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;
}
```
